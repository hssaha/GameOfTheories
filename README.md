web folder contains normal jsp and js files

webPureHTML will only contain the html portions so you can edit them too without needing to install tomcat etc. You can edit this as you please so I can later implement it to the proper HTML. You will be able to see the JSP code, but I will put them in brackets, and for styling purposes. You will know where dynamic text will appear, and if you want you can just write some dummy text, or might even do that. For bits I havent done yet, I will just write down the normal HTML.
